Bangalore House Price Prediction using Machine Learning, Python (Project)
Data driven Analysis and building a Machine Learning Model for House Price Prediction:

Developed a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to predict house prices in Bangalore. This model leveraged dimensionality reduction, outlier removal, and feature engineering (e.g., price_per_sqft) for improved accuracy.
Preprocessed a large dataset (15,000 data points) to address missing values, inconsistencies, and categorical features (One-Hot Encoding).
Employed GridSearchCV and K-Fold cross-validation to optimize the model and ensure generalizability. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared on a hold-out test set.
Demonstrated proficiency in data wrangling (pandas), exploratory data analysis (matplotlib), and model deployment techniques (pickle, JSON).
